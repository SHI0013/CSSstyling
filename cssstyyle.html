    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>Modern technology allows people to be more connected than ever, but this may come at a price. Overuse of social media
    and mobile devices has been linked to eyestrain, difficulty focusing, and depression.
    While some forms of technology may have made positive changes in the world, there is evidence for the negative effects
    of technology and its overuse, as well.
    The overuse of technology may have a more significant impact on developing children and teenagers.
    In this article, learn about the psychological and physical health effects of technology, as well as how to create
    healthful habits with technology and avoid overuse.

    <h4>Isolation</h4>
    <p>Technologies, such as social media, are designed to bring people together, yet they may have the opposite effect in some
    cases.A 2017study in young adults aged 19â€“32 years found that people with higher social media use were more than three times
    as likely to feel socially isolated than those who did not use social media as often.
    Finding ways to reduce social media use, such as setting time limits for social apps, may help reduce feelings of
    isolation in some people.</p><br>
